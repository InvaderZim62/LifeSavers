# Life Savers Puzzle

I can't remember where I got this puzzle, but it's very challenging.  I deceided to get more
practive with SceneKit and Blender, so I turned it into an app.

There are 12 life savers, and only one way they all fit together.  Tap a life saver to move it
into the staging area, where you can rotate and flip it, before dropping it onto the stack.
